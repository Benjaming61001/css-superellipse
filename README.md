# CSS Superellipse Example

This project demonstrates how to create a **superellipse shape** using CSS. A superellipse is a shape that generalizes an ellipse and can be used to form visually interesting and organic curves, such as rounded rectangles with customizable curvature.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the page and displays the superellipse example.
- `styles.css`: Contains all CSS styles, including the code to create the superellipse effect.

## CSS Superellipse Technique

The superellipse effect is achieved by combining multiple `border-radius` techniques on pseudo-elements:

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open index.html in a modern web browser.
3. You will see a centered superellipse created using only CSS.
4. To customize the shape, edit the CSS variables at the top of styles.css:

## css variable
- `bg-color` : Main background color of the superellipse
- `bg-color-contrast` : Contrast color for layered shadows
- `superellipse-width` : Width of the superellipse
- `superellipse-height` : Height of the superellipse
- `superellipse-border-radius` : Base border-radius for the shape
- `overlap-inset` : Inset distance for pseudo-elements
- `overlap-offset` : Negative offset for overlap effect
